Applying some coding principles to Rack patches.

By making use of the *little utils* *teleport* modules, and *Submarine* panel modules it is possible to create the analogue of a pure function containing a complete synthesizer unit. This makes it really easy to assemble a complete performance from prebuilt units, and also easy to see clearly the separate parts of a performance patch. This can be made even easier by including a *MindMeld* *PatchMaster* module in each unit to control the performance parameters of the unit. For example a unit for making wind and wave noises:

To make this work consistently means following a set of conventions.

- All inputs come in via *teleport* on the left of the unit
- All outputs are via teleport on the right hand side of the unit
- Any performance controls are routed to a *PatchMaster* module
- Inputs and outputs are labeled.
- The unit is named.

In this way it is possible to see the seperate parts of the patch at a glance. There are no cables crossing a unit that don't start and end within the unit.

Here is another example. Note the extra *teleport* module included in the *unit* This is there to make wiring it up easier. This can just be dragged next to the mixer and connected to the next free channel.

This unit is designed to make selecting samples easy. The sequencer runs a simple pattern and once a directory full of samples is selected in the *wavbank* module different samnples can be previewed using keyboard shortcuts. If you are using the *start-here* unit it will be *z* and *x* to go forwards and back through the samples. The selected sample can also be triggered with the *a* key.

** Getting started
Here is my *start-here* unit with *mixer*, *audio*, *midi*, *keyboard shortcuts* and *cable colouring*

and a template is provided in *new-unit* that looks like this:

[[file:readme-images/template.png]]

Drag the *teleport* unit from the right hand side to somewhere near the main mixer and connect it to an available channel. The left hand one may not be necessary dependant on what you plan to create. It is likely  you will want to select your clock unit as the source for the input side.
