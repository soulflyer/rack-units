** Bass Drone

[[file:readme-images/bass-drone.png]]

This has no trigger but the pitch will follow the last input on the midi keyboard. Inspired by an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPqC942-LmA][Omri Cohen Video]]

** Pattern Generator

This gives tighter control over notes played in a sequence, the patterns being used to trigger specific scale degrees. The scale can be changed.

In most sequencer/quantizer combinations cv values will not always quantize to the same scale degree for different scales. EG a pattern that generates an ascending scale when quantized to the chromatic scale with only one of each note will produce several consecutive notes the same when quantized to a pentatonic scale. With this player you will still get an ascending scale with every note different.

*** Pattern-Converter
Is section that converts the cv values into scale degree pitches. This is just the right hand half of the unit above, but with added scopes for watching what it does:

*** Pattern-player 
is an earlier version that is limited in the range of notes it can produce is also available in pattern player. This has only one *muxlicer* but it does have lots of debugging aids to help see what is going on:

** Sample-Chooser

The easiest way to wade through collections of samples to find the right sound. Great for *MPC* drums.

** Wind

White noise and filter, great for wave and wind sounds

** Drum-samples

Sequencer and sample player. Available in 2 versions, with and without a mixer:

** Tangerine-Drone

Drone with lots of movement, based on one created by Omri Cohen:
Need to remap the *Mind-Meld* controls. Its more there as a reminder as to which knobs to twiddle...

** Tangerine-Arp

Sequenced babblings, also based on Omri-Cohens work. Variation is provided by playing with the mix level, and the level of the feeds from the sequencer in the *VCA Mix* module. Sounds best if continuously tweaked.
